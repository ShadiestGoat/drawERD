# drawERD

Welcome to drawERD - A fully local Entity Relations Diagram (ERD) drawing tool.

*PS: Its made in svelte <3*

## Project Status

This project is still in development. See the [todo file](/TODO.md) (very useful if viewing with [a TODO.md kanban viewer](https://github.com/coddx-hq/coddx-alpha)) to get a picture of current status & next priorities

## Info

### Is this *really* an ERD drawer?

AFAIK, its actually not. Its actually more of a Data Structure Diagram (DSD), or a United Modeling Language (UML) structure diagram. ERD is just the more well known name for all db-related diagrams
