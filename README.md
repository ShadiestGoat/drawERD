# drawERD

Welcome to drawERD - A fully local Entity Relations Diagram (ERD) drawing tool.

*PS: Its made in svelte <3*

## Project Status

This project is still in development. Its not in a real usable state. Some major features that are still missing are:
- [ ] Table Creator (almost there though t-t)
- [ ] Enums
- [ ] Table node resizing
- [ ] Data saving
- [ ] Data Relations
- [ ] Exporter
- [ ] Various bugs

See the [todo file](/TODO.md) (very useful if viewing with [a TODO.md kanban viewer](https://github.com/coddx-hq/coddx-alpha)) to get a picture of current status & next priorities

## Info

### Is this *really* an ERD drawer?

AFAIK, its actually not. Its actually more of a Data Structure Diagram (DSD), or a United Modeling Language (UML) structure diagram. ERD is just the more well known name for all db-related diagrams
