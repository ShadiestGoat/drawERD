# Contributing Guide

Hiiiii :3
Thank you so much for wanting to open a PR, you're amazing <3

You can just fork this, write whatever, format, commit & open a PR. Don't forget to lint (& lint:fix)

Also - in your PR, make sure that `TODO.md` has been updated!

BTW -- Make sure to be respectful blah blah blah.
